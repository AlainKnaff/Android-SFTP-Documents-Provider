Initial release of this forked version

Changes as compared to last original release:
 - stability fixes for newer Android SDK levels (especially when sftp
 sockets are autoclosed on us by the system)
 - editable accounts (using custom database, rather than Android's
 authentication framework)
 - user-chosable start directory (home directory) on server
 - support for public/private keypairs

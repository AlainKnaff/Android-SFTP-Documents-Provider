This is a Storage Access Framework documents provider for accessing
data via SFTP.

It allows you to directly view or edit data on an sftp server using
Android's file browser, or any SAF capable application's file picker.

Other information:
* No root is required.
* It interact with other apps, which can use it to access the sftp
server.
* Apart from slighlty more difficult initial setup (configuring sftp
accounts, creating and sharing ssh key, making a shortcut to file
browser), it should be very easy to use.

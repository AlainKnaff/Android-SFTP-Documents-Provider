SFTP-SAF is a Storage Access Framework (SAF) documents provider for
accessing data via SFTP.

It allows you to directly view or edit data on an sftp server using
Android's file browser, or any SAF capable application's file picker.

Other information:
* No root is required.
* It interacts with other apps, which can use it to open and edit
documents on the sftp server.
* Apart from initial setup (configuring sftp accounts, creating and
sharing ssh key, invoking the file browser on Android 12 and up), it
should be very easy to use. These steps are documented in
https://github.com/AlainKnaff/Android-SFTP-Documents-Provider/releases

SFTP-SAF is a fork of a software initially developped by Riccardo
Isola.
